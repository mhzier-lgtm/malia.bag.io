        <h1> Lip gloss</h1>

        <p> I always have lip gloss in my bag! I hate feeling like my lips are chapped, also it makes me feel cute! double threat! This is a tinted lip balm so it adds just the right amout of color and it works like chapstick. It also kind of smells like roses which is alwasy fun! My roomate got me this for my birthday last year and I have just been taking it with me everywhere I go.</p>
