        <h3> Fruit Snacks</h3>

        <p id="snac"> I need to carry some kind of sugar with me anywhere i go in case my blood sugar drops low. In one of these pouches are 15g of carbs which is exacly the amount I need. It also comes in a nice little packge so its easy to take with me on the go. These also just taste amazing, sometimes I dont love the texture of fruit snacks but these are just the right amount of gummy.</p>
