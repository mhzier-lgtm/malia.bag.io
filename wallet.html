            <h5> Wallet</h5>

            <p id="wall"> Its alwasy good to carry your wallet with you, as you can see my most prized possesion in my wallet is my Gus's sandwich card. I work on Haight over the weekends and I go to Gus's to get my lunch! I have honetsly made such a routine of it that now my fav cashier Steve not only knows my name and my major but sometimes he will give me an extra punch on my sandwitch card and helps me get closer to my free sandwitch. I also have lots of other fun little items in my wallet because i never clean it out, including all of my highschool student ids, a prescrition for insulin, and my AAA card even though I dont have a car in SF. </p>
